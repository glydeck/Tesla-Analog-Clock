### Introduction
This is a simple javascript clock that uses javascript to render the time as an analog clock. This clock uses no bit mapped images.  All the graphic elements are rendered using CSS and SVG files.  This allows the clock to be small and completly self contained.

I originally intended to use this clock by acessing the web in my Tesla S car.  Since I wrote this the funtionality of the Tesla browser has been downgraded so that the web cannot be accesed while the car is in motion.

### Requirements
The only requirements is an Internet web browser.  The clock seems to work with all browsers that I have tried.

### Installation
When installed on a web site all of the files should be at the same directory level.

### Contents
